# Paper Tiger
[Paper Tiger](https://papertiger.herokuapp.com) is a site that uses machine learning to aid researchers in their efforts to find relevant research papers. Paper Tiger allows users to upload a few papers they have found to be useful in order to generate new recommendations. Unlike a Google search of a topic, which can only accept a few key words to generate results, Paper Tiger analyzes the full contents submitted papers to provide recommnedations. We hope that by using this site, users can find incredible resources they would have otherwise missed and forge new and unexpected paths in their research. 

## Limitations 

Currently, our recommendations are formed from all papers submitted at the [NeurIPS](https://nips.cc)(formerly NIPS) conference. As such, the site will largely only be useful to mathematicans and machine learning researchers for now. However in the upcoming months we hope to expand our data base to a wider variety of research journals and confrences. 

## The Team 

This site was initially created as a team project for [COS 333: Advanced Programming Systems](https://www.cs.princeton.edu/courses/archive/fall18/cos333/). The members were [me](https://github.com/BisratM), [Quinn Donohue](https://github.com/qdonohue), [Michelle Yuen](https://github.com/qdonohue).
